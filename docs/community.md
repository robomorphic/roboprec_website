## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Useful ways to contribute include:

- Adding new kernels.
- Extending RoboPrec to new **analysis back-ends** or **target platforms** (e.g., additional FPGA flows).
- Improving documentation and examples.
- Benchmarking RoboPrec in new application domains (e.g., perception, planning, control).
